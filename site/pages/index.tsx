                Monorepos are incredible for productivity, but the tooling can
                be a nightmare. Between Yarn, TypeScript, React, Babel, Webpack,
                frameworks like Next.js and Gatsby, Jest, Prettier, Rollup,
                ESLint, environment variables, changelogs, and getting VSCode to
                understand it all...there is just a lot of stuff to do (and
                things to mess up). Nothing &ldquo;just works.&rdquo; It&apos;s
                become completely normal to waste entire days on just
                toolingâ€”tweaking configs, writing one-off scripts, and stitching
                stuff together.
              </p>
              <p>We need something else.</p>
              <p>
                A fresh take on the whole setup. Designed to glue everything
                together. A toolchain that works for you and not against you.
                With sensible defaults, but even better escape hatches. Built
                with the same techniques used by the big guys, but in a way that
                doesn&apos;t require PhD to learn or a staff to maintain.
              </p>
              <p>
                With Turborepo, we&apos;re doing just that. We&apos;re
                abstracting the complex configuration needed for most monorepos
                into a single cohesive build systemâ€”giving you a world class
                development experience without the maintenance burden.
